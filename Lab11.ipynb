We'll begin by investigating first-order ODEs involving scalar functions, then continue to see how higher-order ODEs, coupled ODEs, and vector functions can all be investigated using very similar Python code. Specifically, we will be looking at *initial value problems* where the conditions at $t = 0$ are specified (the alternative, *boundary value problems*, might make an interesting final project).\n",
