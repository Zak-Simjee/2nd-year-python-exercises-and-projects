It's a bit difficult to discuss which algorithms are best without knowing the context (e.g., are you checking if an object is there or trying to avoid its boundaries? Are you looking at a single image or video data, where speed might be very important?).

	<th class="overall"> I really liked this project in many respects; I thought it was a nice example of exploring Python libraries. I did appreciate the fact that you still found things to add yourself, but my major criticism is still that the code clearly leans very heavily on the package documentation. Still, well done. <span class="mark">69% B</span></th>
